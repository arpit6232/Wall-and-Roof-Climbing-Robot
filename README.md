# Wall-and-Roof-Climbing-Robot

- Prototype development, design synthesis and manufacturing of a system capable of climbing and transitioning surfaces upto 130Â° rise from horizontal with payload of 4 kg and max speed of 10 cm/s
- Modeled the robot in Solidworks and performed Multi-body simulations for transition mechanism in Motion-View
- Fabrication with Rapid Prototyping design techniques using SolidThinking for optimum design and enhanced payload.
- Developed over 4 different prototypes with different payload and design capabilities for different environment conditions
